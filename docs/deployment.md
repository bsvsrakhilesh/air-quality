# Deployment

## Local production stack

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you want to change defaults, then run:

```powershell
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Stop the stack with `docker compose down`. Add `-v` only when you intentionally want to delete imported datasets and registry state.

`AXIOM_INPUT_DIR` controls the host directory scanned for existing top-level CSV files. The directory is mounted read-only. Browser uploads are persisted in the Docker volume.

## Internet deployment

GitHub hosts the source, CI, security scans, and versioned images in GitHub Container Registry. GitHub Pages cannot run the FastAPI process, so deploy the Compose stack or its two images to a container host.

For a public deployment, place a TLS reverse proxy or managed load balancer in front of the web container and add authentication. Restrict request rates and CPU/memory, use a private object store for uploaded data, scan uploads, back up the state store, and set retention rules before accepting sensitive files.

Images are published on every push to `main` and every `v*` tag:

```text
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repository>-api
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repository>-web
```

The workflow emits provenance and an SBOM for each image.
